                    Before his breakout in acting, Jamie was one half of the folk-pop duo Sons of Jim, alongside childhood friend David Alexander. The band, which was active in the early 2000s, opened for KT Tunstall and gained a cult following in the UK. Though the band eventually disbanded, Jamie’s musical abilities—guitar, vocals, songwriting—remain an important part of his creative identity. <br />
                    He has quietly continued to incorporate music into his career, including singing in Belfast and providing vocals for indie soundtracks. His approach to music mirrors his approach to acting: understated, sincere, and rooted in real emotion.
